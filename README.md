## About Flash Vocab
As a previous educator, I strongly believe in the ability of technology to level the playing field and tackle education inequity. I wanted to create a full stack app aimed at this mission. I personally have spent countless hours and a lot of money and resources for the GRE. I realized there are few free online resources for the GRE that students can easily access.

This app is meant to be a study tool available for anyone who wants to study the GRE to brush up on rigorous vocabulary. Users can view over 2,000 GRE words and definitions. Users can than create their own personal study stack of flashcards with words they need to specifically study.

## Technologies Used
### Front-end technologies
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass
* AJAX
* Bootstrap
* Grunt
* Flexbox

### Back-end technologies (see back-end repo)
* Postgres
* Ruby / Ruby on rails
* Test driven development

## The Front-End Development Process
For the front-end I tried to focus my energy on understanding flexbox and bootstrap. I wanted to create an app that was mobily responsive and allowed users of multiple platforms the same experience. Thus, I worked on using flexbox to align items and percentages of widths and heights to create a sleek design no matter the screen size.

Design does not come easy for me; I struggle with what colors and fonts to use. I tried to read on best practices of web design to get a better sense of what style and layout is most preferred and what best practices are in the industry.

## To be continued!
I would like to make sure everything is part of flexbox in the future. There are still some flaws in the design such as the flip over button that is not in the same place when the card is flipped. I would also like to create a flipping animation for the card in the future so the user can simply tap on the card and the card will flip over in a sleek way.
